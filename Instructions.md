# Unsupervised Learning: K-means Clustering Assessment

## Overview

In this assessment, you will apply K-means clustering to analyze and categorize data points in a dataset. The goal is to explore the concepts of unsupervised learning by experimenting with different cluster numbers and interpreting the clustering results.

## Data Description

You are provided with a dataset (`status_data.csv`) containing features that represent various attributes . Your task is to analyze this dataset, apply K-means clustering, and evaluate the clustering results.

## Instructions

### 1. Load and Explore the Dataset

 **Load the data** and examine its structure.
   - Identify the main features in the dataset. 


### 2. Preprocess the Data

1. **Standardize** the data
   - Consider using a standard scaler to ensure all features contribute equally to the clustering process.

2. **Dimensionality Reduction** (Optional).
   - If there are many features, you might want to reduce the dimensionality using PCA (Principal Component Analysis) or another method. This step helps in visualizing clusters more effectively in two or three dimensions.

### 3. Apply K-means Clustering

1. **Define the number of clusters (k)**.
   - Start by choosing an initial value of `k`, and perform clustering.
   - Experiment with different values of `k` (e.g., 2 to 6) to observe how the clustering results change.

2. **Fit the K-means model** to the dataset.
   - Observe the clustering results and assign each data point to a cluster.

3. **Elbow Method**:
   - Use the Elbow Method to find an optimal `k` value by plotting the sum of squared distances (inertia) against different values of `k`.
   - Based on the Elbow plot, choose the value of `k` where adding more clusters offers diminishing returns on the inertia.

### 4. Interpret the Results

1. **Visualize Clusters**:
   - Create scatter plots to show how clusters are distributed.
   - Color-code the clusters and plot the centroids.

2. **Evaluate Clusters**:
   - Reflect on how well the clusters are separated. Are there clear distinctions between the clusters?
